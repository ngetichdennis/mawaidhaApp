## MawaidhaAPP
## Introduction
The application is a Single Page Application (SPA).I did build the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API. The application displays random wise words from a public API.
## Features
Fetches random advice from a public API
-The application display a card with a button that, when clicked, fetches and displays random advice 
-Users should be able to see a new piece of advice each time they click the "Get Advice" button
-Users can express their appreciation for a particular piece of advice by clicking a "Like" button which then the likes will be stored in the db.json
## Installation
So as to use the app, you need to have installed node.js on the computer. Followed by cloning the repository to local machine. The next step is installing npm package, ’npm install’. Then start npm by running ‘npm start’ which then starts the server.
## Dependencies
The application relies on fetching data from the public API for it to display the quotes on the screen.
## Limitation.
-The application depends on an external API that might not be reliable or available at all times. If the API fails or changes, your web app will not work properly. 
-The application uses a local JSON file to store the number of likes, which means that it will not persist across different devices or sessions
## Contribution
Contribution is welcomed for any review on any part of the SPA.
## Conclusion.
All the requirements were met
